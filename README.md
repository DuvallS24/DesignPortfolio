# Design Portfolio
This repository contains Demos of working game projects and design documents for several games that I am actively developing.  These design documents are intended to show the thought
process I go through when designing game systems and the iteration I do on those ideas.

## Maze Craze
This is a game that is essentially about collecting objects within a randomized maze.  It is heavily inspired by Tom's Maze in Montgomery County Ohio.

## Hockey Manager
This is a project I started due to a desire to play an analytics heavy hockey management game.  While games like it exist, they do not have a lot of built in tools
to allow the player analyze player performances and use real sabermetric techniques to built their team.

## Greyt Race
This project revolves around managing a group of raching greyhounds, and breeding them to obtain faster race dogs.  This is largely inspired by my adoption of my retired Greyhound 'Prismo'.

## Rigged
This is a project that aims to take the mechanics of slot machines and gamify it to be a rouge-lite.  The mechanics are heavily inspired by Balatro and Luck be a Landlord.
